### DISCLAIMER ###

# For the pre-release stage, this program is only compatible for devices with Windows OS.


# This program is written using Python language with details of the library i used for GUI is Tkinter
  and assembled into an executable(.exe) / compiled program using PyInstaller library I'm also using the Pytube library
  to request data and video metadata from the YouTube server.


# I personally have tested and have used this program on more than one Windows OS based device of course
  and the program runs without any problems, so you can freely use it.


# For some devices with Windows Smartscreen activated
  there will be several additional steps so that this program can run
  because windows doesn't recognize the publisher or developer (yes because I'm not a well-known developer like windows or apple :D )
  but don't worry in this repository I also include how to solve it. (check the manual guide about smartscreen bypass).


# Last but not least, because I also use this program as a tool. So this project will be one of the long-term support projects with various feature updates
  and better development than the previous version. So please wait for further developments and don't hesitate to participate as collaborators
  so that this project will be useful for the general public.


# Also don't forget to keep using this tool wisely, because anything in excess is not good. Thank you, and God Bless you. :)
